                      Dana Lewis, a University of Alabama graduate who grew up in Huntsville, used social media, computer skills and mail-order parts to invent an artificial pancreas for people with diabetes. Along with co-inventor and husband Scott Leibrand, she's now giving her discovery away.

                      <p class="card-text">An Escambia County man was arrested after police say he attacked a local fire chief while the official performed an emergency response procedure on the suspect's wife. In the chaotic encounter, emergency units were unable to save the woman's life.

Paramedics found the woman's husband, Christopher Wade Smith, attempting to give her CPR. As Fire Chief Michael Tyler began to assist in providing medical attention to the woman, Smith punched him in the right eye, deputies say.

The attack resulted in "serious injury and fractures", according to officials. EMS was able to remove the woman from the home, loading her onto an ambulance, where she was taken to D.W. McMillan Hospital.

She was pronounced as dead shortly after her arrival.
